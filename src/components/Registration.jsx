        Blue Kaffee allows you to share very personal information. Please make
        use of our privacy features to protect yourself. Giving out your address

        potentially illegal activities is an awful idea. We try to prevent
        harassment, but it is impossible to do so completely. Talk to your
        parents before giving out information that identifies you personally.
        Contact a moderator or administrator if you experience harassment or
        threats. Stay safe.
